## Steps to aquire Unsplash Api Key
- Unsplash API is simple to use. Here are the steps to get started:
- Create a developer account: create an account -> https://unsplash.com/join
- Once you’re in, go to the Menu -> Product -> Developers/API
- Click on Your Apps on New Application
- Add your application’s name and description(anything you want just to aquire key)
- Then you’ll see “Apply for Production” section, but we’re not interested in that yet, so let’s scroll down to 🔑 Keys section (this is where you’ll need to copy your Access key for API requests)
- At the bottom 🔒Permissions section, select "Public access" (you can select all of them if you want to explore all that the API allows).
